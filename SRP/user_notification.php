// Evaluation
// What‚Äôs Good üëç
// Separation of Responsibilities: You've correctly separated user management and notification responsibilities, making each class easier to understand and maintain.
// Reusability: The Notification class can now be reused for other parts of the application if needed, without relying on user registration.
// Suggestions for Further Improvement üí°
// Dependency Injection: Instead of passing the email address directly to the Notification class, consider injecting a Notification instance into UserAccount. This way, you can call the notification directly after registration without requiring the client code to create two separate instances.
// Method Naming and Context: You could also improve the user experience by adding a notifyUser() method inside the UserAccount class, which would call Notification. This approach could better encapsulate user notification needs.
