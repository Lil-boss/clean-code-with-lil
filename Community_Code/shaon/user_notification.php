Final Thoughts
Your refactored code is clear and applies SRP well.
 Using dependency injection takes the flexibility and maintainability even further by allowing UserAccount to control its dependencies more dynamically. 
 Keep up the great work with clean code principles, and let me know if youâ€™d like more examples! -->
